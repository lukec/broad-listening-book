# Ota City, Gunma Prefecture: Introducing AI into “Jibungotokaigi” Citizen Deliberation Meetings

By Shunsuke Takagi (Plural Reality)

So far, we have introduced cases in which local election candidates used broad listening to hear voters’ voices. However, broad listening is not only effective in election settings. It is also beginning to be used in citizen deliberation meetings, where local governments engage in dialogue with residents, as a tool for structuring participants’ diverse views and improving the quality of discussion. Here, we introduce a case from Ota City, Gunma Prefecture, where AI facilitation support was introduced into a citizen deliberation process that has continued for nine years.

For the past nine years, Ota City, Gunma Prefecture, has continuously held randomly selected “Jibungotokaigi” meetings. “Jibungotokaigi” is a citizen deliberation method implemented by Japan Initiative[^kosonippon] in municipalities across the country (see Chapter 11 for the broader picture of the collaboration between Japan Initiative and Plural Reality). Rather than relying on representatives of specific organizations or self-selected applicants, the process brings in randomly selected residents, creating a mechanism that reflects a wide range of local voices and is based on the idea of so-called mini-publics[^minipublics]. Unlike conventional meetings, which tend to be dominated by highly motivated participants, the goal is to create a more representative forum for discussion.

The theme for fiscal year 2025 was “Toward an Ota Where Parents and Children Can Shine with Smiles (Child-Rearing Support),” and four meetings were held between November 2025 and January 2026. About 20 randomly selected residents participated each time, ranging in age from their teens to their 70s, with both people directly involved in child-rearing and those who were not.

This initiative was organized by Ota City with cooperation from Japan Initiative, while Plural Reality LLC (Representative: Shunsuke Takagi; Founder: Shutaro Aoyama) provided AI support as a technical partner. “Baisoku Kaigi”[^baisoku], developed by Plural Reality, is software for supporting citizen deliberation meetings that addresses the tradeoff between conventional surveys (which can reach thousands of people but only ask shallow questions) and workshops (which allow deep dialogue but are limited to around 20 participants). The AI dynamically generates questions for each participant, collects responses via smartphone on a five-point confidence scale, and instantly produces a structured report that automatically identifies areas of agreement, disagreement, and unresolved issues.

![Baisoku Kaigi response screen (Ota City case). On a smartphone, a statement is displayed prominently: “Given the extreme heat in recent years, letting children play in school gymnasiums in the city without air conditioning feels like a health ‘risk.’” Participants respond on a five-point scale: “Strongly agree,” “Agree,” “Don’t know / not confident,” “Disagree,” or “Strongly disagree.” At the bottom of the screen, other participants’ statements continue in sequence—such as views on park cleanliness and safety, or the priority of free school lunches versus park improvements—and users swipe through them one after another to respond. Unlike a conventional survey, the AI dynamically changes the questions based on response patterns.](images/08_01_ota_baisoku_ui.png)

## The Strengths of Mini-Publics—and the Challenges Behind Them

Citizen deliberation meetings based on random selection can create highly representative forums, but they also face a dilemma: the more diverse the participants are, the greater the variation in prior knowledge and level of interest among them. Ota City encountered the following challenges as well:

- **Asymmetry in prior knowledge:** Discussions begin before participants share a common understanding of what the key issues are, causing the conversation to scatter.
- **Lack of psychological safety:** Participants hesitate to speak because they worry, “What if I say something off the mark?”
- **Bias in discussion:** Speaking time tends to be dominated by a few knowledgeable participants or those with louder voices.

As a result, discussions often remained at the level of safe, superficial exchanges and failed to deepen. This is not unique to Ota City; it reflects a broader tradeoff common to resident participation methods in general. Balancing the collection of views from many residents with deep exploration of a single issue, making use of diversity while overcoming stagnation caused by knowledge gaps, and respecting residents’ free expression while translating it into information that can be used in administrative practice—all of these have been difficult to achieve simultaneously with conventional methods.

## Addressing These Challenges with Baisoku Kaigi

By using Baisoku Kaigi, Ota City addressed these issues. Specifically, before discussion begins, participants answer AI-generated questions on their smartphones. The AI then analyzes the results and produces a report summarizing **areas of agreement, disagreement, and unknown issues that no one has yet raised**. This allows both organizers and participants to enter the meeting with a clear understanding of the starting point for discussion.

![Visualization of participant responses using Baisoku Kaigi (Ota City case). Based on participants’ responses, the screen automatically extracts the top three items with the highest agreement, the top three with the greatest disagreement, and the top three with the highest “don’t know / not confident” rates. For each statement, the proportions of agree, disagree, and don’t know are shown, along with free-text comments added by participants. This makes it possible to see at a glance which points are already agreed upon, which are divisive, and which remain uncertain, helping identify which issues should be prioritized for discussion.](images/08_01_ota_response_visualization.png)

### At the Start of Discussion: Sharing the Key Issues

The facilitator projects the advance report onto a screen and presents specific gaps in understanding that deserve particular discussion that day. This makes it possible to ensure psychological safety while moving directly into substantive discussion from the outset. Rather than starting from a vague theme, the conversation begins with clear, data-based questions, preventing diffusion and sharpening participants’ focus.

![Introduction to the Baisoku Kaigi analysis report (Ota City case). Titled “The Overall Picture of Our Shared Understanding: Areas of Agreement, Disagreement, and Uncertainty,” this opening section of the report organizes participants’ responses into “points where everyone is facing in the same direction (agreement),” “points where opinions are divided (disagreement),” and “points where people are unsure how to judge (uncertainty).” As one area of agreement, it highlights the shared view that “support that creates more time and emotional breathing room for parents should be prioritized over purely financial assistance.” This report is projected on the screen as the starting point for discussion.](images/08_01_ota_analysis_report_intro.png)

### Midway Through Discussion: Deepening and Structuring

Baisoku Kaigi also helps organize and visualize participants’ thinking in the middle of discussion. For example, if a participant supports “installing air conditioning in school gymnasiums” but opposes “cutting other budget items to pay for it,” a conventional meeting might simply classify that person as either “for” or “against.” Baisoku Kaigi reads the combination of responses and identifies the underlying position: “This person thinks air conditioning is necessary, but has concerns about how to secure the funding.” It then presents this as a new question to participants. As a result, the discussion shifts away from “Are you for or against it?” toward “Under what conditions could you support it?”—making it easier to generate dialogue rooted in participants’ own experiences and values. Another major feature is that it enables real-time understanding of the structural relationships among opinions, something impossible with sticky notes and poster paper alone.

![Baisoku Kaigi report results (Ota City case). A table extracting points of disagreement from participants’ responses. For issues such as “Should other budget items be cut to install air conditioning?”, “Is responsibility for ensuring safety 100% the government’s or a shared responsibility?”, “Is behavior change by residents themselves necessary?”, and “Incentives for mutual aid,” the report structures how opinions are divided along with analysis and insights. This becomes the starting point for discussion in group work.](images/08_01_ota_issue_extraction.png)

### From “For or Against” to Understanding a Three-Layer Structure

In conventional citizen deliberation meetings and surveys, opinions on a proposal are often reduced to a binary choice: “for” or “against.” Baisoku Kaigi visualizes participants’ responses in three layers: **agreement (points where everyone is facing in the same direction), conflict (points where opinions are divided), and uncertainty (points where people are unsure how to judge)**. This three-layer structure significantly changed the quality of discussion.

For example, the Ota City meetings produced the following kinds of results.

Among the **opinions with high agreement**, 100% of participants supported proposals such as “There needs to be an explanation that also makes sense to residents who do not directly benefit from child-rearing support” and “Introduce paid services in public facilities, such as cafés, to help cover operating costs and give those involved a greater sense of purpose.” These results show that even on issues that might appear divisive on the surface, broad agreement can emerge when the conditions are made concrete.

![Sensemaker’s “Participant Alignment” screen (high agreement tab). The opinions with the highest levels of agreement across all topics and subtopics are displayed in card format. These include statements such as “Introduce paid services in public facilities, such as cafés or candy shops, to help cover operating costs and give those involved a greater sense of purpose,” all of which received 100% support. Clicking each card reveals details such as its topic, vote breakdown, and free-text comments.](images/08_01_ota_alignment_high.png)

At the same time, there were also **issues on which opinions were divided**. Statements such as “Are Kodomo Platz and children’s centers really benefiting children?” and “Is overcrowding in pediatric clinics caused by free medical care?” produced closely split responses, revealing how participants’ positions and experiences shaped their views differently.

![The “low agreement” tab on the same screen. It displays opinions where support and opposition are closely balanced. On issues such as “Are government-provided places for children, such as Kodomo Platz and children’s centers, really benefiting children?” and “Is overcrowding in pediatric clinics caused by free medical care?”, opinions are split at around 50%.](images/08_01_ota_alignment_low.png)

Even more noteworthy were the opinions with high levels of **“don’t know.”** For statements such as “I cannot use Kodomo Platz because the location, hours, and fees do not work for me” and “Support for children with disabilities or medical care needs feels like a distant world that has nothing to do with me,” 100% of participants responded “don’t know / not confident.” This does not indicate conflict, but rather a situation in which participants lack the information or experience needed to make a judgment in the first place. What could not be seen in the conventional binary of support versus opposition—areas where further discussion is still needed—became visible as a third category.

![The “uncertainty” tab on the same screen. It shows opinions for which 100% of participants voted “don’t know / pass.” These include issues such as “Does the current free-care system encourage excessive use, like convenience-store-style doctor visits?” and “Would you use Kodomo Platz if the childcare hours were extended?”, making visible the issues that participants felt unable to judge based on their own experience.](images/08_01_ota_alignment_uncertainty.png)

This three-layer analysis concretely changed the direction of discussion in the meetings. For example, on the issue of “Is responsibility for ensuring safety 100% the government’s, or is it shared with residents?”, Baisoku Kaigi’s analysis revealed that behind the apparent conflict lay an uncertainty: residents wanted to cooperate, but did not know how. When the facilitator presented this analysis on the screen, the discussion shifted away from a blame-oriented “government vs. residents” framing and toward a more constructive question: “How can we create systems that make it easier for residents to cooperate?”

A particularly symbolic example of this shift was the participants’ shared understanding around self-help and public support. While 100% agreed with the statement, “When it comes to child-rearing issues, I sometimes struggle to know where to draw the line between what I should solve myself (self-help) and what I should rely on the government for (public support),” 100% opposed the statement, “Most child-rearing issues should ultimately be solved by the government taking full responsibility.” In other words, participants shared empathy around the difficulty of drawing the line, while also sharing the recognition that not everything should simply be left to government.

![Section titled “Opinions with the highest levels of agreement among participants.” It lists opinions for which more than 70% of participants either agreed or disagreed. Green labels (100% voted in favor) appear on statements such as “I struggle to know where to draw the line between self-help and public support” and “The purpose of this meeting is not simply to make requests, but to think about how responsibilities should be shared.” Red labels (100% voted against) appear on statements such as “Most issues should be solved by the government taking responsibility.” The presence of strong agreement on both support and opposition shows that participants arrived at a shared understanding focused not on “leaving everything to government,” but on thinking through the division of roles among self-help, mutual aid, and public support.](images/08_01_ota_sensemaker_high_agreement.png)

Through Baisoku Kaigi’s three-layer analysis and the discussions it enabled, the simple binary of “self-help or public support” was transformed into the more constructive question of “How should these roles be divided?” Issues that remained in the category of uncertainty were also no longer treated as conflict, but were visualized as “areas where further discussion is needed,” making it clear which themes should be explored more deeply in future meetings.

## Outcomes

In Ota City’s fiscal year 2025 “Jibungotokaigi” meetings, the following outcomes were confirmed:

<!-- TODO: Clarify how outcomes were measured (by whom / how) and what the comparison baseline was (previous years / other municipalities) -->

- **Reduced administrative workload:** Draft reports were generated automatically in about 30 seconds, compared with about one week previously.
- **Qualitative shift in outputs:** Residents’ views shifted from “one-sided requests” to “specific proposals with conditions and reasoning.”
- **Improved participant experience:** The setting changed from one often dominated by louder voices to one where even less outspoken participants could speak with confidence.

One female participant in her 20s commented, “The Baisoku Kaigi system was truly groundbreaking and made it much easier to move the discussion forward. Even I, someone who is not good at speaking in front of others, was able to participate with peace of mind.”

<!-- TODO: Specify the source of the participant comment (survey / interview) and whether permission for use was obtained -->

In addition to these qualitative outcomes, comparative analysis of participant surveys also showed clear improvement.

![Comparative analysis of participant surveys. Overall satisfaction improved from 78% in 2024 to 92% in 2025. Responses of “very good” became overwhelmingly dominant. Negative reactions seen in some 2024 responses, such as “I don’t see the benefit,” disappeared.](images/08_01_ota_survey_satisfaction.png)

Furthermore, the share of respondents rating every item that supports discussion quality as “very good” increased substantially. In particular, “an atmosphere where I could speak comfortably” rose from 53% to 85%, while “the clarity of the coordinator’s facilitation and summaries” improved from 66% to 92%.

![Changes in detailed survey items (pie chart comparison). “Was there an atmosphere where you could speak comfortably?” 53%→85%; “Were you able to express your own opinion?” 53%→70%; “Were the city’s explanations and Q&A easy to understand?” 60%→77%; “Was the coordinator’s facilitation and summarizing easy to understand?” 66%→92%.](images/08_01_ota_survey_safety.png)

The change in participants’ free-response comments was also telling. In 2024, comments centered on the physical environment, with words such as “OTACO,” “no benefit,” and “shy.” In 2025, they shifted dramatically toward the method and psychological safety, with words such as “Baisoku Kaigi,” “easy to talk,” and “felt safe.”

![Resident satisfaction: voices from the field. In 2024, comments centered on “environment / anxiety” (OTACO, no benefit, shy), whereas in 2025 they shifted to “substance / reassurance” (Baisoku Kaigi, easy to talk, felt safe). Comments included: “Even I, someone who is not good at speaking in front of others, was able to participate with peace of mind,” and “It was valuable to hear both the real perspectives of parents and the views of people my own age.”](images/08_01_ota_survey_wordcloud.png)

## Publishing the Discussion Results: Analysis Reports via Sensemaker

The opinions and voting data collected through Baisoku Kaigi were published as a structured analysis report using “Sensemaker,” an open-source opinion analysis tool developed by Google Jigsaw (see Chapter 10)[^ota_report]. In Ota City’s meetings, 1,023 votes were cast on 245 resident opinions, and the AI automatically classified them into four major topics and 13 subtopics.

![Overview screen of the opinion report on child-rearing support in Ota City. As a Sensemaker analysis result, 245 opinions and 1,023 votes are structured into four topics. “Division of roles between self-help and public support, and sustainable administration” (161 items) attracted the largest number of opinions, followed by “Evaluation and side effects of financial support (free provision)” (55 items), “Community ties and the role of mutual aid” (49 items), and “Quality and safety of places for children to spend time and play” (47 items). The distribution of subtopics within each topic is shown in horizontal bar charts.](images/08_01_ota_sensemaker_overview.png)

This report can be [viewed interactively online](https://sense-making.plural-reality.com/ota), where readers can explore not only the three-layer analysis of agreement, conflict, and uncertainty introduced in the previous section, but also detailed opinion distributions by topic, individual opinion texts, and vote breakdowns. Publishing the results of the meetings in a transparent way helps fulfill accountability to residents who were unable to participate, while also serving as an effort to share the outcomes of broad listening more widely.

## The Facilitator’s Perspective

Facilitator Makoto Maeda wrote the following in a personal Facebook post:

<!-- TODO: Add the date of the Facebook post and confirm permission for quotation (keep quotation short) -->

> The power of consensus-building after AI had organized the issues—the first such case in Japan—was extraordinary. [With Plural Reality’s AI facilitation support,] I gained the ability to guide the meeting democratically yet logically, while taking in the feelings of every participant. Of course, I’m relying entirely on outside help, though. (laughs)
>
> Prince Shotoku, who is said to have been able to listen to many people at once, may well have been using AI.

As these words suggest, AI was positioned not as a substitute for human decision-making, but as something that expands human capability. By taking on cognitively demanding tasks such as organizing issues, structuring information, and visualizing patterns, AI freed people from heavy information processing and allowed them to focus on more essential dialogue—such as understanding the values underlying one another’s views.

## What the Ota City Initiative Shows

What the Ota City case demonstrates is that **the greatest challenge in randomly selected deliberative meetings is the asymmetry of prior knowledge among participants, and that an effective response is to visualize participants’ understanding and share the key issues before discussion begins**.

Baisoku Kaigi addressed this challenge in the following ways:

1. Through **advance visualization of participants’ understanding**, everyone could begin discussion with a shared grasp of what the key issues were.
2. By **making areas of agreement and disagreement explicit**, it helped ensure psychological safety and lowered the barrier to speaking.
3. Through **structuring the discussion**, it made it possible to move beyond binary opposition and toward deeper dialogue.

This is an attempt to overcome, through technology, the “tradeoff between scale and depth” discussed in Chapter 2. It preserves the scale and representativeness of random selection while also securing depth of discussion through Baisoku Kaigi. And by making the entire process visible, it increases the sense of legitimacy and understanding for both participants and the local government.

The Ota City initiative marked an important step in expanding the possibilities of randomly selected deliberative meetings.
